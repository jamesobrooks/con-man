# ConMan

ConMan is a fictitious conference management system. It is an implementation of the [All Stuff, No Cruft](http://fundamentalsofsoftwarearchitecture.com/katas/kata?id=AllStuffNoCruft) architectural kata.

## The Kata

### All Stuff, No Cruft

Conference organizer needs a management system for the conferences he runs for both speakers and attendees

#### Users:

- hundreds of speakers
- dozens of event staff
- thousands of attendees

#### Requirements:

- attendees can access speaking schedule online, including room assignments
- speakers can manage talks (enter, edit, modify)
- attendees 'vote up/down' talks
- organizer can notify attendees of schedule changes up-to-the-minute (if attendees opt in)
- each conference (being a different subject) can be branded independently
- speaker slides are accessible online only to attendees
- evaluation system via web page, email, SMS, or phone

#### Additional Context:

- Conference runs across the US.
- Very small support staff.
- 'Bursty' traffic: extremely busy when conference is occurring.
- Conference organizer wants to easily 'skin' the site for different technology offerings.
