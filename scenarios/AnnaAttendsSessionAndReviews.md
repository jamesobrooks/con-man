# Scenario

Anna Attendee is attending BalloonCon2023 in Chicago, IL at the Convention Center. She decides to attend the Birds of South America session so that she can learn how to create beautiful balloon birds. She signals her intent to attend this session on 24 April in Auditorium G at 11:00 AM. On 23 April, Anna checks the BalloonCon app and finds that she has been confirmed for the session. At 10:40 AM on the day of the session, she gets in line to enter the auditorium. The session is very popular and there are many attendees waiting in line. BalloonCon2023 concierge staff offer Anna a drink of water as she waits for the auditorium to empty. At 10:52 AM Anna enters the auditorium and quickly finds a seat. At 10:59 AM Clancy Clown walks on stage and at precisely 11:00 AM begins speaking and demonstrating proper technique for making the most beautiful balloon birds Anna has ever seen. Anna receives (as do all attendees) the balloons necessary to make a Yellow-browed toucanet and follows along as Clancy demonstrates. Later that afternoon, Anna receives a notification from the BaloonCon app that her opinion on the sessions she attended that day has been requested. She gives a glowing review of the Birds of South America session, leaving high marks for interesting subject matter, dynamic speaker, and practical applicability.
